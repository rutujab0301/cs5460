# Homework 3: Boot into C

This assignment will teach you to build a minimal bootable code that boots on real hardware into C. Technically, you can do this assignment on any operating system
that supports the Unix API and can run Qemu (CADE machines, your laptop that runs Linux or Linux VM, and even MacOS, etc.). **You don't need to set up xv6 for
this assignment, but if you're running on CADE you'll have to install QEMU**, see [QEMU setup instructions](./xv6-setup.md). Submit your programs and the shell through
Gradescope (see instructions at the bottom of this page).

> **NOTE: YOU CANNOT PUBLICLY RELEASE SOLUTIONS TO THIS HOMEWORK.** It's ok to show your work to your future employer as a private Git repo, however
any public release is prohibited. For Mac / OSX users: the support of 32-bit applications is deprecated in the latest version of your system. So if you already updated
your system to MacOS Catalina or have updated your XCode then we recommend you to do the homework at the CADE machines. This assignment explains how to
create a minimal x86 operating system kernel using the Multiboot standard. In fact, it will just boot and print `"Hello, world!"` on the screen, and then print `"Hello from
C!"` on the serial line from the `main()` function. Most of this assignment is based on the [intermezzOS project](https://intermezzos.github.io/book/first-edition/multiboot-headers.html).

## Boot overview

When you turn on a computer, it loads the BIOS from some special flash memory. The BIOS runs self-test and initialization routines of the hardware, then it looks for
bootable devices. If it finds one, the control is transferred to its bootloader, which is a small portion of executable code stored at the device's beginning. The
bootloader has to determine the location of the kernel image on the device and load it into memory. It also needs to switch the CPU to the so-called **protected mode**
because x86 CPUs start in the very limited **real mode** by default (to be compatible with programs from 1978). 

We won't write a bootloader because that would be a
complex project on its own (we partially covered this in class since xv6 implements a simple boot loader with two files: `bootasm.S` and `bootmain.c`). Instead, we will
use one of the many well-tested bootloaders out there to boot our kernel from a CD-ROM.

## Multiboot headers

Let's get going! The very first thing we're going to do is create a **multiboot header**. What's that, you ask? Well, to explain it, let's take a small step back and talk
about how a computer boots up.

One of the amazing and terrible things about the x86 architecture is that it's maintained backwards compatibility throughout the years. This has been a competitive
advantage, but it's also meant that the boot process is largely a pile of hacks. Each time a new iteration comes out, a new step gets added to the process. That's
right, when your fancy new computer starts up, it thinks it's an 8086 from 1976. And then, through a succession of steps, we transition through more and more
modern architectures until we end at the latest and greatest.

The first mode is called 'real mode'. This is a 16-bit mode that the original x86 chips used. The second is 'protected mode'. This 32-bit mode adds new things on top
of real mode. It's called 'protected' because real mode sort of let you do whatever you wanted, even if it was a bad idea. Protected mode was the first time that the
hardware enabled certain kinds of protections that allow us to exercise more control around such things as RAM. We'll talk more about those details later.

The final mode is called 'long mode', and it's 64 bits. Since our OS will only enter 32-bit mode, we will not touch 64-bit 'long mode'.

So that's the task ahead of us: make the jump up the ladder and get to 32-bit mode. We can do it! Let's talk more details.

## Firmware and the BIOS

So let's begin by turning the power to our computer on.

When we press the power button, a bunch of low-level initialization protocols are executed: Management Engine, BIOS, etc.

With the BIOS we're already in the land of software, but unlike software that you may be used to writing, the BIOS comes bundled with its computer and is located in
read-only memory (ROM).

One of the first things the BIOS does is run a 'POST' or power-on self-test which checks for the availability and integrity of all the pieces of hardware that the
computer needs including the BIOS itself, CPU registers, RAM, etc. If you've ever heard a computer beeping at you as it boots up, that's the POST reporting its
findings.

Assuming no problems are found, the BIOS starts the real booting process.

##### By the way...

For a while now most commercial computer manufacturers have hidden their BIOS booting process behind some sort of splash screen. It's usually
possible to see the BIOS' logs by pressing some collection of keys when your computer is starting up.

The BIOS also has a menu where you can see information about the computer like CPU and memory specs and all the hardware the BIOS detected like
hard drives and CD and DVD drives. Typically this menu is accessed by pressing some other weird collection of keyboard keys while the computer is
attempting to boot.

The BIOS automatically finds a 'bootable drive’ by looking in certain pre-determined places like the computer's hard drive and CD and DVD drives. A drive is
‘bootable’ if it contains software that can finish the booting process. In the BIOS menu, you can usually change in what order the BIOS looks for bootable drives or tell
it to boot from a specific drive.

The BIOS knows it's found a bootable drive by looking at the first few kilobytes of the drive and looking for some magical numbers set in that drive's memory. This
won't be the last time some magical numbers or hacky-sounding things are used on our way to building an OS. Such is life at such a low level...

When the BIOS has found its bootable drive, it loads part of the drive into memory and transfers execution to it. With this process, we move away from what comes
dictated by the computer manufacturer and move ever closer to getting our OS running.

### Bootloaders

The part of our bootable drive that gets executed is called a 'bootloader', since it loads things at boot time. The bootloader's job is to take our kernel, put it into
memory, and then transition control to it.

Some people start their operating systems journey by writing a bootloader. For example, in class we started by looking at the xv6 bootloader that is loaded by the
BIOS at the `0x7c00` address. In this assignment we will not be doing that.

In the interest of actually getting around to implementing a kernel, instead, we'll use an existing bootloader: GRUB.

### GRUB and Multiboot

GRUB stands for 'grand unified bootloader', and it's a common one for GNU/Linux systems. GRUB implements a specification called Multiboot, which is a set of
conventions for how a kernel should get loaded into memory. By following the Multiboot specification, we can let GRUB load our kernel.

The way that we do this is through a 'header'. We'll put some information in a format that Multiboot specifies right at the start of our kernel. GRUB will read this
information, and follow it to do the right thing.

One other advantage of using GRUB: it will handle the transition from real mode to protected mode for us, skipping the first step. We don't even need to know
anything about all of that old stuff. If you're curious about the kinds of things you would have needed to know, put "A20 line" into your favorite search engine, and get
ready to cry yourself to sleep.

### Writing our own Multiboot header

I said we were gonna get to the code, and then I went on about more history. Sorry about that! It's code time for real! You can download the entire folder that contains
skeletons for the homework files [here](./src/) or save it file by file. Inside your homework folder there is a file called `multiboot_header.asm`. Open it in your favorite editor. I
use `vim`, but you should feel free to use anything you'd like.

```sh
$ vim multiboot_header.asm
```

This is a `.asm` file, which is short for 'assembly'. That's right, we're going to write some assembly code here. Don't worry! It's not super hard.

#### An aside about assembly
Have you ever watched Rich Hickey's talk "Simple vs. Easy"? It's a wonderful talk. In it, he draws a distinction between these two words, which are commonly used as synonyms.

Assembly coding is simple, but that doesn't mean that it's easy. We'll be doing a little bit of assembly programming to build our operating system, but we don't need to know that much. It is completely learnable, even for someone coming from a high-level language. You might need to practice a bit, and take it slow, but I believe in you. You've got this. A good manual on NASM assembler is [here](https://nasm.us/doc/nasmdoc3.html).

#### The Magic Number

Our first assembly file will be almost entirely data, not code. Here's the first line:

```assembly
dd 0xe85250d6 ; magic number
```

Ugh! Gibberish! Let's start with the semicolon (`;`). It's a comment that lasts until the end of the line. This particular comment says 'magic number'. As we said, you'll
be seeing a lot of magic numbers in your operating system work. The idea of a magic number is that it's completely and utterly arbitrary. It doesn't mean anything. It's
just magic. The very first thing that the multiboot specification requires is that we have the magic number `0xe85250d6` right at the start.

##### By the way...

Wondering how a number can have letters inside of it? `0xe85250d6` is written in hexadecimal notation. Hexadecimal is an example of a "numeral system",
which is a fancy term for a system for conveying numbers. The numeral system you're probably most familiar with is the decimal system, which conveys
numbers using a combination of the symbols `0 - 9`. 

Hexadecimal, on the other hand, uses a combination of 16 symbols: `0 - 9` and `a - f`. Along with its fellow
numeral system, binary, hexadecimal is used a lot in low-level programming. In order to tell if a number is written in hexadecimal, you may be tempted to
look for the use of letters in the number, but a more surefire way is to look for a leading `0x`. While `100` isn't a hexadecimal number, `0x100` is.

What's the value in having an arbitrary number there? Well, it's a kind of safeguard against bad things happening. This is one of the ways in which we can check that
we actually have a real multiboot header. If it doesn't have the magic number, something has gone wrong, and we can throw an error.

I have no idea why it's `0xe85250d6`, and I don't need to care. It just is.

Finally, the `dd` directive. It's short for 'define double word'. It declares that we're going to stick some 32-bit data at this location. Remember, when x86 first started, it was a 16-bit architecture. That meant that the amount of data that could be held in a CPU register (or one 'word' as it's commonly known) was 16 bits. To transition to a 32-bit architecture without losing backwards compatibility, x86 got the concept of a 'double word', or double 16 bits.

#### The Mode Code

Okay, time to add a second line:

```assembly
dd 0xe85250d6 ; magic number
dd 0          ; protected mode code
```

This is another form of magic number. We want to boot into protected mode, and so we put a zero here, using dd again. If we wanted GRUB to do something else, we could look up another code, but this is the one that we want.

### Header length

The next thing that's required is a header length. We could use `dd` and count out exactly how many bytes our header is, but there's two reasons why we're not
doing that:

1. Computers should do math, not people.
2. We're going to add more stuff, and we'd have to recalculate this number each time. Or wait until the end and come back. See #1.

Here's what this looks like:

```assembly
header_start:
    dd 0xe85250d6          ; magic number
    dd 0                   ; protected mode code
    dd header_end - header_start ; header length
header_end:
```

You don't have to align the comments if you don't want to. I usually don't, but it looks nice and after we're done with this file, we're not going to mess with it again, so we won't be constantly re-aligning them in the future.

The `header_start:` and `header_end:` things are called 'labels'. Labels let us use a name to refer to a particular part of our code. Labels also refer to the memory occupied by the data and code which directly follows it. So in our code above, the label `header_start` points directly to the memory at the very beginning of our magic number and thus to the very beginning of our header.

Our third dd line uses those two labels to do some math: the header length is the value of header_end minus the value of header_start. Because header_start and header_end are just the addresses of places in memory, we can simply subtract to get the distance between those two addresses. When we compile this assembly code, the assembler will do this calculation for us. No need to figure out how many bytes there are by hand. Awesome.

You'll also notice that I indented the dd statements. Usually, labels go in the first column, and you indent actual instructions. How much you indent is up to you; it's a pretty flexible format.

### The Checksum

The fourth field Multiboot requires is a 'checksum'. The idea is that we sum up some numbers, and then use that number to check that they're all what we expected
things to be. It's similar to a hash, in this sense: it lets us and GRUB double-check that everything is accurate.

Here's the checksum:

```assembly
header_start:
    dd 0xe85250d6          ; magic number
    dd 0                   ; protected mode code
    dd header_end - header_start ; header length

    ; checksum
    dd 0x100000000 - (0xe85250d6 + 0 + (header_end - header_start))
header_end:
```

Again, we'll use math to let the computer calculate the sum for us. We add up the magic number, the mode code, and the header length, and then subtract it from a big number. dd then puts that value into this spot in our file.

##### By the way...

You might wonder why we're subtracting these values from `0x100000000`. To answer this we can look at what [the multiboot spec](https://nongnu.askapache.com/grub/phcoder/multiboot.pdf) says about the
checksum value in the header:

> The field `checksum` is a 32-bit unsigned value which, when added to the other magic fields (i.e. `magic`, `architecture`, and `header_length`), must
> have a 32-bit unsigned sum of zero.

In other words:
```
checksum + magic_number + architecture + header_length = 0
```
We could try and "solve for" checksum like so:
```
checksum = -(magic_number + architecture + header_length)
```
But here's where it gets weird. Computers don't have an innate concept of negative numbers. Normally, we get around this by using "signed integers", which is something we cover in an appendix. The point is we have an unsigned integer here, which means we're limited to representing only positive numbers. This means we can't literally represent `-(magic_number + architecture + header_length)` in our field.

If you look closely at the spec, you'll notice it's strangely worded: it's asking for a value that, when added to other values, has a sum of zero. It's worded this way because integers have a limit to the size of numbers they can represent, and when you go over that size, the values wrap back around to zero. So 0xFFFFFFFF + 1 is 0x00000000. This is a hardware limitation: technically, it's doing the addition correctly, giving us the 33-bit value 0x100000000, but we only have 32 bits to store things, so it can't actually tell us about that 1 in the most significant digit position! We're left with the rest of the digits, which spell out zero.

So what we can do here is "trick" the computer into giving us zero when we do the addition. Imagine for the sake of argument that `magic_number + architecture + header_length` somehow works out to be 0xFFFFFFFE. The number we'd add to that in order to make zero would be 0x00000002. This is 0x100000000 - 0xFFFFFFFE because 0x100000000 technically maps to zero when we wrap around. So we replace 0xFFFFFFFE in our contrived example here with  `magic_number + architecture + header_length`. This gives us: `dd 0x100000000 - (0xe85250d6 + 0 + (header_end - header_start))`



### Ending tag

After the checksum, you can list a series of "tags", which is a way for the OS to tell the bootloader to do some extra things before handing control over to the OS, or
to give the OS some extra information once started. We don't need any of that yet, though, so we just need to include the required "end tag", which looks like this:

```assembly
header_start:
    dd 0xe85250d6          ; magic number
    dd 0                   ; protected mode code
    dd header_end - header_start ; header length

    ; checksum
    dd 0x100000000 - (0xe85250d6 + 0 + (header_end - header_start))

    ; required end tag
    dw 0   ; type
    dw 0   ; flags
    dd 8   ; size
header_end:
```

Here, we use `dw` to define a 'word' instead of just data. Remember, a 'word' is 16 bits or 2 bytes on the x86_64 architecture. The Multiboot specification demands that this be exactly a word. You'll find that this is super common in operating systems: the exact size and amount of everything matters. It's just a side-effect of working at a low level.

### The Section

We have one last thing to do: add a 'section' annotation. We'll talk more about sections later, so for now, just put what I tell you at the top of the file.

#### Here's the final file:

```assembly
section .multiboot_header

header_start:
    dd 0xe85250d6          ; magic number
    dd 0                   ; protected mode code
    dd header_end - header_start ; header length

    ; checksum
    dd 0x100000000 - (0xe85250d6 + 0 + (header_end - header_start))

    ; required end tag
    dw 0   ; type
    dw 0   ; flags
    dd 8   ; size
header_end:
```

That's it! Congrats, you've written a multiboot compliant header. It's a lot of esoterica, but it's pretty straightforward once you've seen it a few times.

### Assembling with nasm
We can't use this file directly, we need to turn it into binary. We can use a program called an 'assembler' to 'assemble' our assembly code into binary code. It's very similar to using a 'compiler' to 'compile' our source code into binary. But when it's assembly, people often use the more specific name.

We will be using an assembler called nasm to do this. You should invoke nasm like this:
```
$ nasm -f elf32 multiboot_header.asm
```
The `-f elf32` says that we want to output a file as 32bit ELF.

After you run this command, you should see a `multiboot_header.o` file in the same directory. This is our 'object file', hence the `.o`. Don't let the word 'object' confuse you. It has nothing to do with anything object oriented. 'Object files' are just binary code with some metadata in a particular format - in our case ELF. Later, we'll take this file and use it to build our OS.

You can inspect the bytes of the header with `hexdump`(depending on the environment the address may be different but the following content should be somewhere in the ouput)
``` assembly 
> hexdump -x multiboot_header.o
0000000    50d6    e852    0000    0000    0018    0000    af12    17ad
0000010    0000    0000    0008    0000
0000018
```
### Summary
Congratulations! This is the first step towards building an operating system. We learned about the boot process, the GRUB bootloader, and the Multiboot specification. We wrote a Multiboot-compliant header file in assembly code, and used `nasm` to create an object file from it.

Next, we'll write the actual code that prints "Hello world" to the screen.

## Hello, World!

Now that we've got the headers out of the way, let's do the traditional first program: Hello, world!

### The smallest kernel
Our hello world will be just 20 lines of assembly code. Let's begin. Open a file called `boot.asm` and put this in it:

```
start:
    hlt
```

You've seen the name: form before: it's a label. This lets us name a line of code. We'll call this label start, which is the traditional name. GRUB will use this convention to know where to begin.

The `hlt` statement is our first bit of 'real' assembly. So far, we had just been declaring data. This is actual, executable code. It's short for 'halt'. In other words, it ends the program.

By giving this line a label, we can call it, sort of like a function. That's what GRUB does: "Call the function named `start`." This function has just one line: stop.

Unlike many other languages, you'll notice that there's no way to say if this 'function' takes any arguments or not. We'll talk more about that later.

This code won't quite work on its own though. We need to do a little bit more bookkeeping first. Here's the next few lines:
```
global start

section .text
bits 32
start:
    hlt

```
Three new bits of information. The first:
```
global start
```

This says "I'm going to define a label `start`, and I want it to be available outside of this file." If we don't say this, GRUB won't know where to find its definition. You can kind of think of it like a 'public' annotation in other languages.
```
section .text
```
We saw `section` briefly, but I told you we'd get to it later. The place where we get to it is at the end of this chapter. For the moment, all you need to know is this: code goes into a section named `.text`. Everything that comes after the `section` line is in that section, until another section line.

```
bits 32
```
GRUB will boot us into protected mode, aka 32-bit mode (similar to how xv6 bootloader starts in 16bit real mode GRUB will be loaded by the BIOS and will switch into protected 32bit mode for us). But we have to specify directly that assembler has to generate 32bit code. Our Hello World will only be in 32 bits.

That's it! We could theoretically stop here, but instead, let's actually print the "Hello world" text to the screen. We'll start off with an 'H':
```
global start

section .text
bits 32
start:
    mov word [0xb8000], 0x0248 ; H
    hlt
```
This new line is the most complicated bit of assembly we've seen yet. There's a lot packed into this little line.

The first important bit is `mov`. This is short for move, and it sorta looks like this:
```
mov size place, thing
```
Oh, `;` starts a comment, remember? So the `; H` is just for us. I put this comment here because this line prints an H to the screen!

Yup, it does. Okay, so here's why: `mov` copies `thing` into `place`. The amount of stuff it copies is determined by size.
```
;   size place      thing
;   |    |          |
;   V    V          V
mov word [0xb8000], 0x0248 ; H
```

"Copy one word: the number `0x0248` to ... some place."

The `place` looks like a number just like `0x0248`, but it has square brackets `[]` around it. Those brackets are special. They mean "the address in memory located at this number." In other words, we're copying the number `0x0248` into the specific memory location `0xb8000`. That's what this line does.

Why? Well, we're using the screen as a "memory mapped" device. Specific positions in memory correspond to certain positions on the screen. And the position `0xb8000` is one of those positions: the upper-left corner of the screen.


##### By the way...

"Memory mapping" is one of the fundamental techniques used in computer engineering to help the CPU know how to talk to all the different physical components of a computer. The CPU itself is just a weird little machine that moves numbers around. It's not of any use to humans on its own: it needs to be connected to devices like RAM, hard drives, a monitor, and a keyboard. The way the CPU does this is through a bus, which is a huge pipeline of wires connecting the CPU to every single device that might have data the CPU needs. There's one wire per bit (since a wire can store a `1` or a `0` at any given time). A 32-bit bus is literally 32 wires in parallel that run from the CPU to a bunch of devices like Christmas lights around a house.

There are two buses that we really care about in a computer: the address bus and the data bus. There's also a third signal that lets all the devices know whether the CPU is requesting data from an input (reading, like from the keyboard) or sending data to an output (writing, like to the monitor via the video card). The address bus is for the CPU to send location information, and the data bus is for the CPU to either write data to or read data from that location. Every device on the computer has a unique hardcoded numerical location, or "address", literally determined by how the thing is wired up at the factory. In the case of an input/read operation, when it sends `0x1001A003` out on the address bus and the control signal notifies every device that it's a read operation, it's asking: "What is the data currently stored at location `0x1001A003`?" If the keyboard happens to be identified by that particular address, and the user is pressing SPACE at this time, the keyboard says, "Oh, you're talking to me!" and sends back the ASCII code `0x00000020` (for "SPACE") on the data bus.

What this means is that memory on a computer isn't just representing things like RAM and your hard drive. Actual human-scale devices like the keyboard, the mouse, the video card have their own memory locations too. But instead of writing a byte to a hard drive for storage, the CPU might write a byte representing some color and symbol to the monitor for display. There’s an industry standard somewhere that says video memory must live in the address range beginning `0xb8000`. In order for computers to work out of the box, this means the BIOS needs to be manufactured to assume video memory lives at that location and the motherboard (which is where the bus is all wired up) has to be manufactured to route a `0xb8000` request to the video card. It's kind of amazing this stuff works at all!  Anyway, "memory mapped hardware", or "memory mapping" for short, is the name of this technique.

Now, we are copying `0x0248`  
Why this number? Well, it's in three parts:
```

 __ background color
/  __foreground color
| /
V V
0 2 48 <- letter, in ASCII
```
We'll start at the right. First, two numbers are the letter, in ASCII. H is 72 in ASCII, and 48 is 72 in hexadecimal: `(4 * 16) + 8 = 72`. So this will write `H`.

The other two numbers are colors. There are 16 colors available, each with a number. Here's the table:

```

| Value | Color          |
|-------|----------------|
| 0x0   | black          |
| 0x1   | blue           |
| 0x2   | green          |
| 0x3   | cyan           |
| 0x4   | red            |
| 0x5   | magenta        |
| 0x6   | brown          |
| 0x7   | gray           |
| 0x8   | dark gray      |
| 0x9   | bright blue    |
| 0xA   | bright green   |
| 0xB   | bright cyan    |
| 0xC   | bright red     |
| 0xD   | bright magenta |
| 0xE   | yellow         |
| 0xF   | white          |

```
So, `02` is a black background with a green foreground. Classic. Feel free to change this up, use whatever combination of colors you want!

So this gives us a `H` in green, over black. Next letter: `e`
```
global start

section .text
bits 32
start:
    mov word [0xb8000], 0x0248 ; H
    mov word [0xb8002], 0x0265 ; e
    hlt
```
Lower case `e` is `65` in ASCII, at least, in hexadecimal. And `02` is our same color code. But you'll notice that the memory location is different.

Okay, so we copied four hexadecimal digits into memory, right? For our `H. 0248.` A hexadecimal digit has sixteen values, which is 4 bits (for example, 0xf would be represented in bits as 1111). Two of them make 8 bits, i.e. one byte. Since we need half a word for the colors (02), and half a word for the H (48), that's one word in total (or two bytes). Each place that the memory address points to can hold one byte (a.k.a. 8 bits or half a word). Hence, if our first memory position is at 0, the second letter will start at `2`.

You might be wondering, "If we're in 32 bit mode, isn't a word 32 bits?" since sometimes 'word' is used to talk about native CPU register size. Well, the 'word' keyword in the context of x86_64 assembly specifically refers to 2 bytes, or 16 bits of data. This is for reasons of backwards compatibility.

This math gets easier the more often you do it. And we won't be doing that much more of it. There is a lot of working with hex numbers in operating systems work, so you'll get better as we practice.

With this, you should be able to get the rest of Hello, World. Go ahead and try if you want: each letter needs to bump the location twice, and you need to look up the letter's number in hex.

If you don't want to bother with all that, here's the final code:
```
global start

section .text
bits 32
start:
    mov word [0xb8000], 0x0248 ; H
    mov word [0xb8002], 0x0265 ; e
    mov word [0xb8004], 0x026c ; l
    mov word [0xb8006], 0x026c ; l
    mov word [0xb8008], 0x026f ; o
    mov word [0xb800a], 0x022c ; ,
    mov word [0xb800c], 0x0220 ;
    mov word [0xb800e], 0x0277 ; w
    mov word [0xb8010], 0x026f ; o
    mov word [0xb8012], 0x0272 ; r
    mov word [0xb8014], 0x026c ; l
    mov word [0xb8016], 0x0264 ; d
    mov word [0xb8018], 0x0221 ; !
    hlt
```

Finally, now that we've got all of the code working, we can assemble our boot.asm file with nasm, just like we did with the multiboot_header.asm file:
```
$ nasm -f elf32 boot.asm
```
This will produce a boot.o file. We're almost ready to go!
### Linking it together
Okay! So we have two different `.o` files: `multiboot_header.o` and `boot.o`. But what we need is one file with both of them. Our OS doesn't have the ability to do anything yet, let alone load itself in two parts somehow. We just want one big binary file.

Enter 'linking'. If you haven't worked in a compiled language before, you probably haven't had to deal with linking before. Linking is how we'll turn these two files into a single output: by linking them together.

Open up a file called `linker.ld` and put this in it:

```
ENTRY(start)
  
SECTIONS {
  . = 0x100000; /* Tells GRUB to load the kernel starting at the 1MB mark */

  .rodata :
  {
    /* ensure that the multiboot header is at the beginning */
    KEEP(*(.multiboot_header))
    *(.rodata .rodata.*) 
    . = ALIGN(4K);
  }

  .text :
  { 
    *(.text .text.*)
    . = ALIGN(4K);
  } 
    
  .data :
  { 
    *(.data .data.*)
    . = ALIGN(4K);
  }   
    
  .bss :
  {   
    *(.bss .bss.*)
    . = ALIGN(4K);
  }     
} 
```
This is a 'linker script'. It controls how our linker will combine these files into the final output. Let's take it bit-by-bit:
```
ENTRY(start)
```
This sets the 'entry point' for this executable. In our case, we called our entry point by the name people use: start. Remember? In boot.asm? Same name here.
```
SECTIONS {
```
Okay! I've been promising you that we'd talk about sections. Everything inside of these curly braces is a section. We annotated parts of our code with sections earlier, and here, in this part of the linker script, we will describe each section by name and where it goes in the resulting output.

```
. = 0x100000;
```
This line means that we will start putting sections at the one megabyte mark. This is the conventional place to put a kernel, at least to start. Below one megabyte is all kinds of memory-mapped stuff. Remember the VGA stuff? It wouldn't work if we mapped our kernel's code to that part of memory... garbage on the screen!

```
.rodata :
```
This will create a section named rodata. And inside of it...

```
*(.multiboot_header)
```
... goes every section named multiboot_header. Remember how we defined that section in multiboot_header.asm? It'll be here, at the start of the boot section. That's what we need for GRUB to see it.

```
.text :
```
Next, we define a text section. The text section is where you put code. And inside of it...

```
*(.text)
```
... goes every section named `.text`. See how this is working? The syntax is a bit weird, but it's not too bad.

We do the same for the code and bss section.

That's it for our script! We can then use ld to link all of this stuff together:
```
$ ld -m elf_i386 -T linker.ld -o kernel.bin multiboot_header.o boot.o
```
Recall that on Mac OS X you will want to use the linker we installed to ~/opt and not your system linker. For example, if you did not change any of the defaults in the installation script, this linker will be located at `$HOME/opt/bin/x86_64-pc-elf-ld.`

By running this command, we do a few things:

```
-m elf_i386
```
ask the linker to generate the 32bit.
```
-T linker.ld
```
This is the linker script we just made, we ask the linker to use it.
```
-o kernel.bin
```
This sets the name of our output file. In our case, that's kernel.bin. We'll be using this file in the next step. It's our whole kernel!
```
multiboot_header.o boot.o
```
Finally, we pass all the `.o` files we want to link together.

That's it! We've now got our kernel in the `kernel.bin` file. Next, we're going to make an ISO out of it, so that we can load it up in QEMU.


## Making an ISO
Now that we have our `kernel.bin`, the next step is to make an ISO. Remember compact discs? Well, by making an ISO file, we can both test our Hello World kernel in QEMU, as well as running it on actual hardware!

To do this, we're going to use a GRUB tool called grub2-mkrescue. We have to create a certain structure of files on disk, run the tool, and we'll get an hello.iso file at the end.

Doing so is not very much work, but we need to make the files in the right places. First, we need to make several directories:
```
$ mkdir -p build/isofiles/boot/grub
```
The `-p` flag to `mkdir` will make the directory we specify, as well as any 'parent' directories, hence the `p`. In other words, this will make a `build` directory with a `isofiles` directory inside that has `boot` inside, and finally the `grub` directory inside of that.

Next, create the `grub.cfg` file inside of that `build/isofiles/boot/grub` directory, and put this in it:
```
set timeout=0
set default=0

menuentry "cs5460os" {
    multiboot2 /boot/kernel.bin
    boot
}
```
This file configures GRUB. Let's talk about the `menuentry` block first. GRUB lets us load up multiple different operating systems, and it usually does this by displaying a menu of OS choices to the user when the machine boots. Each `menuentry` section corresponds to one of these. We give it a name, in this case, cs5460os, and then a little script to tell it what to do. First, we use the `multiboot2` command to point at our kernel file. In this case, that location is `/boot/kernel.bin`. Remember how we made a `boot` directory inside of `isofiles`? Since we're making the ISO out of the `isofiles` directory, everything inside of it is at the root of our ISO. Hence `/boot`.

Let's copy our `kernel.bin` file there now:
```
$ cp kernel.bin build/isofiles/boot/
```
Finally, the `boot` command says "that's all the configuration we need to do, boot it up."

But what about those `timeout` and `default` settings? Well, the `default` setting controls which `menuentry` we want to be the default. The numbers start at zero, and since we only have that one, we set it as the default. When GRUB starts, it will wait for `timeout` seconds, and then choose the default option if the user didn't pick a different one. Since we only have one option here, we just set it to zero, so it will start up right away.

The final layout should look like this:

```
build/
|---isofiles/
    |---boot
        |-- grub
        |   |-- grub.cfg
        |-- kernel.bin
```
Using `grub2-mkrescue` is easy. We run this command:
```
$ grub2-mkrescue -o hello.iso build/isofiles
```
The `-o` flag controls the output filename, which we choose to be `hello.iso`. And then we pass it the directory to make the ISO out of, which is the build/isofiles directory we just set up.

Note, if you're on a CADE machine, likely you don't have the GRUB i386 module (we have no control over cade unfortunately, but that's ok). We have a fix: use the wget command to download the [i386 module](./gr.zip) to the project directory and unzip it. Like this:
```
wget https://users.cs.utah.edu/~aburtsev/5460/hw/hw3-boot-into-c/gr.zip
unzip gr.zip
```
You then need to add the following option `-d lib/grub/i386-pc` (to use the i386) to the grub2-mkrescue command.
```
$ grub2-mkrescue -d lib/grub/i386-pc -o hello.iso build/isofiles
```
Do not include this option or the lib folder in your final submission. Use it only for your development on CADE

After this, you have an `hello.iso` file with our teeny kernel on it. You could burn this to a USB stick or CD and run it on an actual computer if you wanted to! But doing so would be really annoying during development. So in the next section, we'll use an emulator, QEMU, to run the ISO file on our development machine.

### Troubleshooting GRUB issues
There is a chance you might encounter the following issue:
```
grub-mkrescue: error: xorriso not found 
```


Solution: if on your own machine, install `xorriso`. If on CADE, wget the [xorriso](./xorriso) binary, run `chmod +x xorriso` and add it the your `$PATH`. For example, if you are using `bash` and the `xorriso` binary is in `~/bin`, append `export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH` to your `.bashrc`.

## Running in QEMU
Let's actually run our kernel! To do this, we'll use [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/), a full-system emulator. Using QEMU is fairly straightfoward.

If you're running on CADE inside an ssh terminal you don't have a GUI interface, hence we need to use `-curses`, Curses is a library that is designed to facilitate GUI-like functionality on a text-only device (see a [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)))
```
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -curses -cdrom hello.iso
```
Type it in, hit Enter, and you should see `Hello, world!` (To exit, hit `Esc+2` and type `quit` in the console.)

If you're running on your own machine with a GUI terminal you can simply run:
```
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom hello.iso
```
You should see something what really looks like a screen of the computer with `Hello, world!` (To exit, hit `Alt+2` and type `quit` in the console.)

If it shows up for you too, congrats! If not, something may have gone wrong. Double check that you followed the examples exactly. Maybe you missed something, or made a mistake while copying things down.

Note all of this other stuff behind the Hello World message: this part may look different, based on your version of GRUB, and also since we didn't clear the screen, everything from GRUB just stays as it is. We'll write a function to do that eventually...

Let's talk about this command before we move on:
```
qemu-system-x86_64
```
We're running the `x86_64` variant of QEMU. While we have a 32-bit kernel the QEMU emulates x86 64bit architecture. And since 32bit code is part of it everything works.
```
-cdrom hello.iso
```
We're going to start QEMU with a CD-ROM drive, and its contents are the `hello.iso` file we made.

That's it! Here's the thing, though: while that wasn't too complicated, it was a lot of steps. Each time we make a change, we have to go through all these steps over again. In the next section, we'll use Make to do all these steps for us.

### Troubleshooting GRUB issues
Again, if you see the following error on the screen:
```
Boot failed: Could not read from CDROM (code 0004)
```
See the `i386` module issue on CADE above.

## Automation with Make
Typing all of these commands out every time we want to build the project is tiring and error-prone. It's nice to be able to have a single command that builds our entire project. To do this, we'll use make. Download this [Makefile](./src/Makefile) and look over it.

To make this Makefile working move create boot folder in the same directory as Makefile and put previously created grub.cfg into boot folder.

The makefile starts by defining several variables `kernel`, `iso`, `linker_script`, and `grub_cfg` that define names of the output files we want to make. `CFLAGS` is a variable that defines all flags to the GCC compiler.
```
kernel := build/kernel.bin
iso := build/hello.iso

linker_script := linker.ld
grub_cfg := boot/grub.cfg

CFLAGS = -fno-pic -static -fno-builtin -fno-strict-aliasing -O1 -Wall -MD -ggdb -m32 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -Werror -nostdlib -fno-stack-protector

target ?= hello
```
We then create two lists: a list of assembly files in the folder `assembly_source_files` and a list of C source files, `c_source_files`. We then use the `patsubst` command to generate another two lists that are the same file names but with `.o` as extension:
```
assembly_source_files := $(wildcard *.asm)
assembly_object_files := $(patsubst %.asm, build/%.o, $(assembly_source_files))
c_source_files := $(wildcard *.c)
c_object_files := $(patsubst %.c, build/%.o, $(c_source_files))
```
```
.PHONY: all clean qemu qemu-nox qemu-gdb qemu-gdb-nox 

all: $(kernel)

        rm -rf build

        @echo "Done"

$(iso): $(kernel) $(grub_cfg)
        @mkdir -p build/isofiles/boot/grub
        cp $(kernel) build/isofiles/boot/kernel.bin
        cp $(grub_cfg) build/isofiles/boot/grub
        grub2-mkrescue -o $(iso) build/isofiles #2> /dev/null
        @rm -r build/isofiles

        ld -m elf_i386  -T $(linker_script) -o $(kernel) $(assembly_object_files) $(c_object_files)

# compile C files
build/%.o: %.c
        @mkdir -p $(shell dirname $@)
        gcc $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

# compile assembly files
build/%.o: %.asm
        @mkdir -p $(shell dirname $@)
        nasm -felf32 $< -o $@
```
Our default action is `all` (it will build the kernel by invoking the linker). Of course before linking the kernel, all object files have to be compiled.

Also it's nice to add targets which describe a specific actions. To run the kernel we add a rule
```
qemu: $(iso)
        qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom $(iso) -vga std -s -serial file:serial.log
```
Finally, there's another useful common rule: `clean`. The `clean` rule should remove all of the generated files, and allow us to do a full re-build.

Now there's just one more wrinkle. We have four targets that aren't really files on disk, they are just actions: `default`, `build`, `run` and `clean`. Remember we said earlier that make decides whether or not to execute a command by comparing the last time a target was built with the last-modified-time of its prerequisites? Well, it determines the last time a target was built by looking at the last-modified-time of the target file. If the target file doesn't exist, then it's definitely out-of-date so the command will be run.

But what if we accidentally create a file called clean? It doesn't have any prerequisites so it will always be up-to-date and the commands will never be run! We need a way to tell make that this is a special target, it isn't really a file on disk, it's an action that should always be executed. We can do this with a magic built-in target called `.PHONY`:
```
.PHONY: default build run clean
```
## Paging
Up until now we did a lot of work that wasn't actually writing kernel code. So let's review what we're up to:

1. GRUB loaded our kernel, and started running it.
2. We're currently running in 'protected mode', a 32-bit environment.
3. But we are still using the GDT created by the GRUB boot loader

Our plan now:

1. Initialize our own GDT and switch to it.
2. Initialize a page table and switch to it.
3. Setup stack and call into main.

### Paging
Paging is implemented by a part of the CPU called an 'MMU', for 'memory management unit'. The MMU will translate virtual addresses into their respective physical addresses automatically; we can write all of our software with virtual addresses only. The MMU does this with a data structure called a 'page table'. As an operating system, we load up the page table with a certain data structure, and then tell the CPU to enable paging. This is the task ahead of us; it's required to set up paging before we transition to long mode.

How should we do our mapping of physical to virtual addresses? You can make this easy, or complex, and it depends on exactly what you want your OS to be good at. Some strategies are better than others, depending on the kinds of programs you expect to be running. We're going to keep it simple, and use a strategy called 'identity mapping'. This means that every virtual address will map to a physical address of the same number. Nothing fancy.

Let's talk more about the page table. In 32bit mode, the page table is two levels deep, and each page is 4096 bytes in size. What do I mean by levels? Here are the official names:

+ Page-Directory Table (PD)
+ Page Table (PT)

### Setting up GDT
To start using a new GDT we really need help from assembly language. There is a small window of time right after we load the GDT when the data and stack segments may still point to an old GDT and any memory or stack instruction will crash us.

The rest, i.e., initialization of the GDT, can be done from C. In many ways using C is better -- it's less error prone, more portable, and in general just feels nice.

We declare or GDT in [main.c](./src/main.c) like
```
struct segdesc gdt[NSEGS] = {
    [SEG_KCODE] = SEG(STA_X|STA_R, 0, 0xffffffff, 0),
    [SEG_KDATA] = SEG(STA_W, 0, 0xffffffff, 0),
};
```
In other words it's an array of NSEGS entries (we need only 3, one is a default NULL entry, one for kernel code, and one for kernel data.

Each element of the array is a segment descriptor defined in [mmu.h](./src/mmu.h) as a C data structure:
```
// Segment Descriptor
struct segdesc {
  uint lim_15_0 : 16;  // Low bits of segment limit
  uint base_15_0 : 16; // Low bits of segment base address
  uint base_23_16 : 8; // Middle bits of segment base address
  uint type : 4;       // Segment type (see STS_ constants)
  uint s : 1;          // 0 = system, 1 = application
  uint dpl : 2;        // Descriptor Privilege Level
  uint p : 1;          // Present
  uint lim_19_16 : 4;  // High bits of segment limit
  uint avl : 1;        // Unused (available for software use)
  uint rsv1 : 1;       // Reserved
  uint db : 1;         // 0 = 16-bit segment, 1 = 32-bit segment
  uint g : 1;          // Granularity: limit scaled by 4K when set
  uint base_31_24 : 8; // High bits of segment base address
};
```
Lots of bitfileds! But if you carefully compare it with the picture from the Intel Software Developer Manual you will see that the layout is exactly the same.

We also use macros to instantiate individual segment descriptor entries:
```
#define SEG(_type, _base, _lim, _dpl) (struct segdesc)    \
{ .lim_15_0 = ((_lim) >> 12) & 0xffff, \
  .base_15_0 = (uint)(_base) & 0xffff, \
  .base_23_16 = ((uint)(_base) >> 16) & 0xff, \
  .type = _type, \
  .s = 1, \
  .dpl = _dpl, \
  .p = 1,       \
  .lim_19_16 = (uint)(_lim) >> 28, \
  .avl = 0, \
  .rsv1 = 0, \
  .db = 1, \
  .g = 1, \
  .base_31_24 = (uint)(_base) >> 24 }

```
Finally, since our goal is to load the new GDT into the GDTR register, we need a GDT descriptor (remember it has the size - 1 of the GDT and it's base location). In C we can do it like this:
```
struct gdtdesc gdtdesc = { .limit = sizeof(gdt) - 1, .base =(uint) &gdt[0] };
```
Where the data structure itself is defined to match the definition from the Intel SDM:
```
// To force compiler to use 1 byte packaging
#pragma pack(1)
struct gdtdesc {
  ushort limit;
  uint base;
};
```
One interesting detail is the `#pragma pack(1)` directive that asks the compiler to avoid padding the data structure fields (without it the compiler will try to add another `ushort` in between `limit` and `base` fields).

Now in our assembly code we're ready to reload the GDT like this:
```
    lgdt [gdtdesc]
```
Finally, to start using the GDT we have to perform a long jump to make sure that the CS register is reloaded from the new GDT. We do it by jumping to the label right below the current jump instruction/
```
    jmp SEG_KCODE:reload_cs
reload_cs:

    ; load 0 into all data segment registers
    mov ax, SEG_KDATA
    mov ss, ax
    mov ds, ax
    mov es, ax
    mov fs, ax
    mov gs, ax
```
Here `SEG_KCODE` and `SEG_KDATA` are defined in assembly to match the entries for code and data in our GDT:

```
%define SEG_KCODE (1 << 3)
%define SEG_KDATA (2 << 3)
```
##### Your assignment is to implement the GDT switch described above
### Setting up the stack
Now, since we have a GDT we can move on with a page table. The page table can be entirely done in C. We can set up the stack and jump into main.

The stack we can define in either C or assembly (your choice, I don't see any harm in a simple asm definition, although arguably C is a little cleaner).
```
section .bss
align 4096

stack:
    resb 4096; Reserve this many bytes
```
Then you initialize the stack like
```
mov esp, stack + 4096
call main
```
Just make sure that ASM knows about the main symbol.
```
; make sure ASM knows about main
; put this somewhere at the top of your boot.asm file
extern main
```
If you choose to declare in C you can use something like:
```
__attribute__((__aligned__(PGSIZE)))
char c_stack[PGSIZE];
```
And then this in assembly to load it into the ESP register
```
; make sure the c_stack is visible in assembly
extern c_stack

  ...

  mov esp, c_stack + 4096
```

### Creating the page table
Now we can go with creating a page table. Again, to make it simple, we will simply will use C to define the page table similar to how xv6 defines the entry page directory, but with 4K pages.
```
// Entry 0 of the page table maps to physical page 0, entry 1 to
// physical page 1, etc.
__attribute__((__aligned__(PGSIZE)))
pte_t entry_pgtable[NPTENTRIES] = {
    0x000000 | PTE_P | PTE_W,
    0x001000 | PTE_P | PTE_W,
    0x002000 | PTE_P | PTE_W,
    0x003000 | PTE_P | PTE_W,
    ...
};

__attribute__((__aligned__(PGSIZE)))
pde_t entry_pgdir[NPDENTRIES] = {
    // Map VA's [0, 4MB) to PA's [0, 4MB)
    [0] = ((uint)entry_pgtable) + PTE_P + PTE_W,
};
```
In this homework you have to map the first 2MB of virtual memory to the first 2MB of physical memory. Of course writing 512 entries by hand looks a bit ugly, so you are welcome to automate it with a loop if you like.
Inside `main()` you can add this code to first load the page table into the CR3 register, and then enable paging by updating the CR0 register.
```
    write_cr3((uint)&entry_pgdir);

    int cr0 = read_cr0();
    cr0 |= CR0_PG;
    write_cr0(cr0);
```
### Compiling main()
Download the skeleton for the [main.c](./src/main.c), [console.c](./src/console.c), and [console.h](./src/console.h) files. A minimal `main()` function can look something like this:
```
#include "console.h"

int main(void)
{
    // Initialize the page table here

    // Initialize the console
    uartinit(); 
    
    printk("Hello from C\n");
    
    return 0; 
} 
```
It calls the `uartinit()` function to initialize the serial line and then prints "Hello from C" on the serial line.

Serial ports are a legacy communications port common on IBM-PC compatible computers. Use of serial ports for connecting peripherals has largely been deprecated in favor of USB and other modern peripheral interfaces, however it is still commonly used in certain industries for interfacing with industrial hardware such as CNC machines or commercial devices such as POS terminals. Historically it was common for many dial-up modems to be connected via a computer's serial port, and the design of the underlying UART hardware itself reflects this.

Serial ports are typically controlled by UART hardware. This is the hardware chip responsible for encoding and decoding the data sent over the serial interface. Modern serial ports typically implement the RS-232 standard, and can use a variety of different connector interfaces. The DE-9 interface is the one most commonly used connector for serial ports in modern systems.

Serial ports are of particular interest to operating-system developers since they are much easier to implement drivers for than USB, and are still commonly found in many x86 systems. It is common for operating-system developers to use a system's serial ports for debugging purposes, since they do not require sophisticated hardware setups and are useful for transmitting information in the early stages of an operating-system's initialization. Many emulators such as QEMU and Bochs allow the redirection of serial output to either stdio or a file on the host computer.

#### Why Use a Serial Port?
During the early stages of kernel development, you might wonder why you would bother writing a serial driver. There are several reasons why you might:
+ GDB debugging You can use the serial port to connect to a host computer, and use the GDB debugger to debug your operating system. This involves writing a stub for GDB within your OS.
+ Headless console You can operate the computer without a monitor, keyboard or mouse and instead use the serial port as a console using a protocol such as TTY or VT100.
+ External logging When the system itself is in danger of potentially crashing at times, it's nice to get debugging outputs safe to another computer before the test system triple-faults.
+ Networking and File transfers Serial ports are useful for transferring information between systems when other more traditional methods are unavailable.
### Serial line driver
To print something on the serial line we need to implement a minimal serial line driver. In this homework assignment we provide you a simple serial driver in `console.c`. It still makes sense for you to look over the page that describes the details of the serial line protocol Serial Ports @ OSDev.org. At a high level we define which I/O port serial line is connected to:
```
#define COM1    0x3f8
```
We then use a couple of helper functions that provide the interface to assembly in and out instructions.
```
static inline unsigned char inb(unsigned short port)
{
    unsigned char data;

    asm volatile("in %1,%0" : "=a" (data) : "d" (port));
    return data;
}

static inline void outb(unsigned short port, unsigned char data)
{
    asm volatile("out %0,%1" : : "a" (data), "d" (port));
}
```
We then use the `uartinit()` function to initialize the serial line interface
```
void uartinit(void)
{

  // Turn off the FIFO
  outb(COM1+2, 0);

  // 9600 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, parity off.
  outb(COM1+3, 0x80);    // Unlock divisor
  outb(COM1+0, 115200/115200);
  outb(COM1+1, 0); 
  outb(COM1+3, 0x03);    // Lock divisor, 8 data bits.
  outb(COM1+4, 0);
  outb(COM1+1, 0x01);    // Enable receive interrupts.
    
  // If status is 0xFF, no serial port.
  if(inb(COM1+5) == 0xFF)
      return;
    
  uart = 1;

  // Acknowledge pre-existing interrupt conditions;
  // enable interrupts.
  inb(COM1+2);
  inb(COM1+0);
}
```
The `uartputc()` displays an individual character on the screen
```
void uartputc(int c)
{
  int i;

  if(!uart)
      return;

  for(i = 0; i < 128 && !(inb(COM1+5) & 0x20); i++)
      microdelay(10);

  outb(COM1+0, c);
}
```
And finally the `printk()` function prints a string on the screen
```
void printk(char *str)
{
    int i, c;

    for(i = 0; (c = str[i]) != 0; i++){
        uartputc(c);
    }
}
```
## Booting into C
Now we're finally ready to boot into C. If you put all the files in the correct places, you can run make and get "Hello from C" on the serial line. The serial line is configured to be recorded in the `serial.log` file.
```
make qemu
```
Remember if you're using your own code, disable the -curses flag in the Makefile. And finally if you want to see only the console (not the VGA) you can run
```
make qemu-nox
```

## Debugging with GDB
Another intersting skill to learn while working on this homework is debugging kernels with GDB. To do this we will be using GDB's remote debugging feature and QEMU's remote GDB debugging stub. Remote debugging is a very important technique for kernel development in general: the basic idea is that the main debugger (GDB in this case) runs separately from the program being debugged (the xv6 kernel atop QEMU) - they could be on completely separate machines, in fact.
### Finding and breaking at an address
For example, if you want to break at the very first instruction of your kernel you can use `readelf` tool to see where this address is (remember the kernel is the same ELF file that you loaded in your previous homework):
```
readelf -h build/kernel.bin
ELF Header:
  Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 01 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
  Class:                             ELF32
  Data:                              2's complement, little endian
  Version:                           1 (current)
  OS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V
  ABI Version:                       0
  Type:                              EXEC (Executable file)
  Machine:                           Intel 80386
  Version:                           0x1
  Entry point address:               0x1010f0
```
In this case, the entry point is `0x1010f0`.

Now we can start QEMU with GDB and break at this address. Open two terminals, either using a terminal multiplexer like [tmux](https://linuxize.com/post/getting-started-with-tmux/) or in another teminal. Run `make qemu-gdb` in the first terminal. In the other terminal, change directory, and start gdb.
```
CADE$ make qemu-gdb
```



















``` 
put .gdbinit file to the path of your homework 3.

```
What you see on the screen is the assembly code of the BIOS that QEMU executes as part of the platform initialization. The BIOS starts at address `0xfff0` (you can read more about it in the [How Does an Intel Processor Boot?](https://binarydebt.wordpress.com/2018/10/06/how-does-an-x86-processor-boot/) blog post). You can single step through the BIOS machine code with the `si` (single instruction) GDB command if you like, but it's hard to make sense of what is going on so lets skip it for now and get to the point when QEMU starts executing the xv6 kernel.

Set a breakpoint at the address of the entry point, e.g.




                     VGA Blank mode

#### Troubleshooting GDB issues
It might be possible that you get the following error on gdb.
```
circinus-1:1001-/16:40>gdb
.
.
.
warning: File "/home/aburtsev/projects/cs5460/hw3/.gdbinit" auto-loading has been 
declined by your `auto-load safe-path' set to "$debugdir:$datadir/auto-load:/usr/bin/mono-gdb.py".
To enable execution of this file add
	add-auto-load-safe-path /home/aburtsev/projects/cs5460/hw3/.gdbinit
line to your configuration file "/home/aburtsev/.gdbinit".
To completely disable this security protection add
	set auto-load safe-path /
line to your configuration file "/home/aburtsev/.gdbinit".
For more information about this security protection see the
"Auto-loading safe path" section in the GDB manual.  E.g., run from the shell:
	info "(gdb)Auto-loading safe path"
```

GDB uses a file called `.gdbinit` to initialize things. We provide you with a `.gdbinit` [file](./src/.gdbinit) with the required setup. However, to allow this local .gdbinit file to be used, we have to add the a line to the global .gdbinit file. Add this line to `/home/<your_username>/.gdbinit`.
```
add-auto-load-safe-path /home/aburtsev/projects/cs5460/hw3/.gdbinit
```
Try to examine the gdbinit file that we provide you. It tells gdb that the file to read symbols from while debugging is in build/kernel.bin . Since we are using remote-debugging, gdb and the target environment communicate a network socket. The other lines in the gdbinit set up the communication.
##### Making yourself familiar with GDB
This part of the homework teaches you how to use GDB. If your OS and GDB are still running exit them. You can exit QEMU by it with **Ctrl-A X** (or if you're running on CADE you will have to press Esc-2 to switch to the QEMU command prompt and then type **quit**. You can exit GDB by pressing **Ctrl-C** and then **Ctrl-D**.

Start your OS and gdb again as you did before. Use two terminals: one to start the OS in QEMU (`make qemu-gdb`) and one to start GDB (`gdb`)

Now we explore the other ways of setting breakpoints. Instead of `br *0x001010f0`, you can use the name of the function or an assembly label, e.g., to set the breakpoint at the beginning of the `start` label you can use:
```
 (gdb) br start 
```
BTW, autocomplete works inside GDB, so you can just type "s" and hit Tab.
Similar you can set the breakpoint on the main() function.
```
(gdb) br main
```
If you need help with GDB commands, GDB can show you a list of all commands with
```
(gdb) help all
```
Now since you set two breakpoints you can continue execution of the system until one of them gets hit. In gdb enter the "c" (continue) command to run xv6 until it hits the first breakpoint (`_start`).
```
(gdb) c
```
Now use the `si` (step instruction) command to single step your execution (execute it one machine instruction at a time). Remember that the _start label is defined in the assembly file, `entry.S` to be the entry point for the kernel. Enter `si` a couple of times. Note, you don't have to enter si every time, if you just press "enter" the GDB will execute the last command.
```
(gdb) si
```
Every time you enter `si` it executes one machine instruction and shows you the next machine instruction so you know what is coming next
```
(gdb) si
=> 0x10000f:	or     $0x10,%eax
0x0010000f in ?? ()
```
You can switch between ATT and Intel disassembly syntax with these commands:
```
(gdb) set disassembly-flavor intel
(gdb) set disassembly-flavor att
```
You can either continue single stepping until you reach your code or the main() function, or you can enter "c" to continue execution until the next breakpoint.
```
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, 0x00000000001010f0 in start ()
```
The moment you reach the C code, you should be able to view the C source alongside using the l (list) command. Since we compiled the kernel with the "-g" flag that includes the symbol information into the ELF file we can see the C source code that we're executing.
```
Breakpoint 2, main () at main.c:14
14	{
(gdb) l
9	{
10	    asm volatile("hlt" : : );
11	}
12	
13	int main(void)
14	{
15	    int i; 
16	    int sum = 0;
```
Remember that when you hit the `main` breakpoint GDB showed you that you're at line 14 in the main.c file (`main.c:14`). You can either step into the functions with the s (step) command (note, in contrast to the `si` step instruction command, this one will execute **one C line at a time**), or step over the functions with the n (next) command which will not enter the function, but instead will execute it till completion.

Try stepping into one of the functions you built. Once gdb has stopped at the line where you invoke a function, type `s` for `step`.
```
(gdb) s
```
The whole listing of the source code seems a bit inconvenient (entering l every time you want to see the source line is a bit annoying). GDB provides a more conventional way of following the program execution with the TUI mechanism. Enable it with the following GDB command
```
(gdb) tui enable
```
Now you see the source code window and the machine instructions at the bottom. You can use the same commands to walk through your program. You can scroll the source with arrow keys, PgUp, and PgDown.

TUI can show you the state of the registers and how they are changing as you execute your code
```
(gdb) tui reg general
```
TUI is a very cute part of GDB and hence it makes sense to read more about various capabilities http://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/TUI-Commands.html. For example, you can specify the assembly layout to single step through machine instructions similar to source code:
```
(gdb) layout asm
```
Or you can use them both (try it)
```
 (gdb) layout split
```
Or you can look at the registers too:
```
 (gdb) layout regs
```
[Beej's Quick Guide to GDB](https://beej.us/guide/bggdb/) is a wonderful introduction to GDB using TUI.


You can also print variables and data structures. For example, to see what's the value of the gdt variable you can do
```
p gdt
```
If you want to see the address of the gdt variable:
```
p &gdt
```
Similar for the GDT descriptor
```
p gdtdesc
```
If you want to print it as raw memory (3 ushorts shown as hex, for example)
```
x /3xh &gdtdesc
```
## Debugging with QEMU's built-in monitor
QEMU has a built-in monitor that can inspect and modify the machine state. To enter the monitor press Alt + 2 . Some of the following commands should be helpful in the monitor.
`info mem`
```
QEMU 4.0.0 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) info mem
0000000000000000-0000000000400000 0000000000400000 -rw
(qemu)
```
This displays mapped virtual memory and permissions. The above example tells us that `0x0000000000400000` bytes of memory from `0x0000000000000000` to `0x0000000000400000` are mapped read/write.
`info registers`

This displays a full dump of the machine's internal register state. Note that GDT shows the limit and base of the GDT (this is helpful!)

## Implementing the page table
Finally, **your assignment is to implement all the boot code that we've discussed above and in addition a page table that maps the first 8MB of virtual addresses to the first 8MB of physical memory**. At the moment we discussed a page table that maps first 4MB, you need to define and construct a new page table once you boot into `main()`.

## Extra credit: (15% bonus)
